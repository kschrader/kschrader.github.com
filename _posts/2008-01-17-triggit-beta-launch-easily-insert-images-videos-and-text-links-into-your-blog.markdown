<p>Today marks the official beta launch of <a href="http://triggit.com/">Triggit</a>, the tech side of which is run by my friend <a href="http://www.karmalab.org/~rt">Ryan Tecco</a> (who co-founded <a href="http://www.tentonlabs.com">Ten Ton Labs</a> with me a few years ago).</p>

<p>So what's a Triggit?  It's an easy way to insert images, videos, or text links into your blog, without downloading or installing any software.  </p>

<p>All you have to do is add one line of code to your blogging software template. You can then use a cool Javascript based tool to insert objects into your blog on the fly. As you can see in the picture below, the Triggit interface just overlays itself on the top of your site to allow you to insert things:</p>

<p>You just select what type of object you want to insert and then drop it into the page wherever you want.  For instance, I've used Triggit to insert this image, of Ryan dressed like a cow from Halloween a few years ago, into this post by searching for it on Flickr through their interface, and simply dropping it in below:</p>

<p>This is a game-changing sort of tool that will make your life as a blogger much easier. If anyone wants to try it out, I have 300 invite codes to the beta to hand out. Just use the access code 'kurt' when you sign up.</p>
