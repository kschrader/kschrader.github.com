<p>I've been writing a lot of Ruby code lately, and I think that my friend Ryan best expressed the biggest problem that I've seen with it so far:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The problem is that I get something done in two lines of code that I normally get done in about 10 in another language, but I always seem to sit there thinking that there must be a way to do it in one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the worst problem in the world to have.</p>
