<p>When I was starting <a href="http://www.tentonlabs.com">my first company</a> and moving out to San Francisco a year and a half ago, I remember attending one of the first meetings of <a href="http://www.sfwin.org/">SFWIN</a>.  I took place in the backroom of a sushi place and had about 20 or 30 people at it.  Everyone there was an entrepreneur first and foremost, but I remember the meeting having a distinctly geeky feel about it.  </p>

<p>Fast forward to the present day, and the geeks are pretty much gone.  I've been to a ton of networking events since that first one, and I've watched them fill up with more and more suits (and a bunch of geeks, me included, turn more and more into suits).  This is good, as it means that there's lots of money floating around the Valley right now, and it has helped me learn a ton about business since those early days, but there isn't really anyplace anymore that has that geeky edge to it.</p>

<p>It looks like someone is finally taking steps to change all of that.  I got an e-mail today from Christian Perry of <a href="http://www.sfbeta.com/">SF Beta</a> announcing <a href="http://www.geeksessions.com/">geekSessions</a>, a new networking event in the SF area that tries to inject a bit of the geek back into things.   It's not quite in the back room of a sushi place anymore, but hey, we're all used to spending our time at throwing down drinks at 111 Minna now, so I guess the <a href="http://cityclubsf.com/">upgrade</a> was inevitable.  </p>

<p>Sounds like a great idea to me.</p>
