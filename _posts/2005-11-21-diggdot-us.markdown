<p>This pretty much encapsulates my morning browsing habits.  <a href="http://diggdot.us/" title="diggdot.us">Best Thing Ever</a>.  (via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/11/20/instantly-hooked-on-diggdotus/" title="Instantly Hooked on Diggdot.us">TechCrunch</a>, of course.)</p>

<p>Sombody needs to make a tool where I can just feed in a number of feeds like this and come up with a site that aggregates them and kills the dupes.  Can't be that hard, right?</p>
