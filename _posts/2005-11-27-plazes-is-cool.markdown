<p>Just saw a post about <a href="http://www.plazes.com" title="Plazes">Plazes</a> over on <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2005/11/crazy-plazes.html" title="Crazy Plazes">HorsePigCow</a> and I have to say that it's a pretty awesome app.  I can never seem to figure out where any of the people that I consult with are at any given time, and, on the flip side of that coin, no one ever seems to know where I am since I seem to fly back and forth between San Francisco and New York on about a weekly basis.  Now they'll be able to check my <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/whereis/kurt" title="plazes.beta: Where is Kurt Schrader">whereis page</a> and find out right away.</p>

<p>It looks like there are a few ways to get the information about where I am out of system, but I'm not seeing an RSS feed, which I was hoping to integrate in to my blog.  Hopefully I just missed it or there's one coming soon.  I would rather not have to redirect everyone to that whereis page all of the time.  </p>

<p>Now I just need to get everyone else I know to sign-up for <a href="http://www.plazes.com" title="Plazes">Plazes</a> and I'll be able to see where all of my friends are.  </p>
