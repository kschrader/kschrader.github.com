<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" title="MacBook Pro">MacBook Pro</a>.  </p>

<p>Stupid Name, but I'm sure I'll be ordering one.  </p>

<p>I'm just waiting for confirmation that it can run Windows as well.  </p>

<p>It looks like I might finally be free from carrying my Powerbook and my Dell to work every day.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs and Apple, my back, which is aching from carrying two laptops everyday, thanks you.</p>

<p>Update:  Anybody see a number for battery life?  Hopefully this thing runs longer than the old Powerbooks, but I haven't seen anything about it yet.</p>
