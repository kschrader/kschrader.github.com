<p>Apparently the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/18/naked-conversations-party-at-techcrunch/" title="Naked Conversations Party at TechCrunch">TechCrunch BBQ</a> is the hottest thing going these days in the Valley.  It took all of 45 minutes last night for the all of the spots to fill up for the next one, and now numerous people (including myself) are upset that they missed out.</p>

<p>If the appetite is so big for something like this, would it be worth organizing something else on the same night for everyone who didn't get in?  It could be like a consolation prize for everyone who missed out.  Perhaps we could grab a space somewhere, hack Scoble's e-mail to replace the directions to the TechCrunch house, and hijack the entire party.  Anybody want to sponsor that?</p>

<p>If anyone has any good ideas for something, drop them in the comments.</p>
