<p>It seems that yesterday was the day that my co-hosting provider was moving all of my <a href="http://www.squishr.com" title="Squishr">Squishr</a> boxes from one location to another, and our app got bonked.  Of course, it's also the day a bunch of traffic comes in from a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/30/viewscore-aggregates-gadget-reviews/" title="">TechCrunch comment</a> and then gets routed to an old landing page for the app that hasn't been up for months.</p>

<p>Oh well, things are back up now.  The lesson here is to make sure that your machine comes back up in the correct state after being rebooted.  Live and learn, I suppose.</p>
