<p>Please, please, stop cluttering my feed reader with reviews of MacBook Pros.  I think everyone understands by now that:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're faster than a Powerbook when running universal apps.</li>
<li>They're slower than a Powerbook when running code through Rosetta.</li>
<li>Other than that it's just like a PowerPC based Mac.</li>
<li>It's <strong>really super great</strong> to program Ruby on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wonderful.  Enough.</p>

<p>Unless someone gets a MacBook Pro that can fly or shoot lasers out of it's iSight, I think that we've all had enough of the same review over and over again.</p>
