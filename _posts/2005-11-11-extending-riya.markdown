<p>I've been seeing <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69514,00.html" title="Riya Eases Pain of Pile of Pix">a lot</a> <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2005/11/riya_eases_pain.html" title="Riya Eases Pain of Pile of Pix">of talk</a> about <a href="http://www.riya.com/" title="Riya">Riya</a> over the last few days, and I must say that it looks pretty cool.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure if Riya is going to have open APIs to their service, but if they do then I hope that someone takes the opportunity to build a dating service on top of their technology.  It seems to me that, with minimal training, the system could match up people with others who they find attractive, as well as give an indication of how attractive they would be to that person.  Although this probably wouldn't be a great indicator of how well those people actually get along, it would be cool nonetheless, and a killer feature for a dating site to have.</p>
