title: Should I Care If You Use Ruby (or Any Other Language For That Matter)?

<p>It seems like every time I post something bad about a programming language, or compare one language (A) to another (B), at least one commenter lets me know that they like language B better, and furthermore, some aspect of my post has convinced them that language A is so bad that they won't even try it anymore.</p>

<p>The thing is, I don't care.</p>

<p>I'm not a consultant anymore. I'm not trying to sell you anything (unless you need <a href="http://www.collaborativedrug.com">drug discovery software</a>). I'm no longer actively involved in open source community. If you don't want to ever try Ruby (or Smalltalk, or Python, or whatever) it really doesn't matter to me.</p>

<p>When I point out something about a language, I'm just doing it because I genuinely think that it is better than something else.</p>

<p>So how do I really feel about languages?</p>

<p>Well, over the last couple of months I've written code in Ruby, Smalltalk, Javascript, Python (if you haven't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProgramming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications%2Fdp%2F0596529325%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211961731%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=schradblog-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Programming Collective Intelligence</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schradblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> you should), Java, and even PHP (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/">SearchMonkey</a> is seriously cool, if you haven't checked it out).</p>

<p>So what language do I think that you should program in?</p>

<p>All of the above, and as many more as possible.</p>

<p>Learn about <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html">functional programming</a>. And <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_containers.html">iterator methods</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure">closures</a> And <a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/python/continuations.html">continuations</a>.</p>

<p>Even more importantly (from my selfish point of view), learn about things that other programming languages can do that I don't know about.</p>

<p>Then hopefully someday we'll be able to have a discussion about programming languages without resorting to pointless statements like "I still prefer braces over keywords for blocks" and instead we'll get comments that we can all learn something from.</p>
