<p>As I've been looking at how to write a business plan lately, I've been reading everything I can about the matter and the only consensus I can find is that there is no consensus.  Today we've got another <a href="http://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.com/2005/11/how-to-not-write-business-plan.html" title="How To NOT Write A Business Plan">post about the matter from David Cowan</a> over at Bessemer that, while helpful, is completely different from what I've heard and read from other people.  </p>

<p>Going through this exercise, I've realized that, for me at least, the best thing to do is write a short business plan, pull a couple of pitch decks (long and short) out of it and then get back to work on the technology.  I just get the feeling that it's better to blow away a VC (or a VC's friend, or family member, etc) with a nice tech demo and then back it up with whatever form of the business plan they ask for, than to just drop a 20 page document or Powerpoint deck onto their desk.  I would much rather have someone put their time and money into me and my idea who's seen at least a rough draft of my vision.  Am I way off base here or does this make sense?</p>
