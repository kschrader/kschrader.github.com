<p>I've often wondered how a brand new college graduate can come in to a company and show them how to manage their people better.  I always figured that it was just some sort of a really good scam.  Good to see that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/10b.html" title="Oh, the emails you'll get...">Joel has figured out how works</a>.  Now we just have to figure out why people keep falling for it...</p>
