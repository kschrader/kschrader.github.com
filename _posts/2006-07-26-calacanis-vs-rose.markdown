<p>I can't believe that Kevin Rose is <a href="http://krose.typepad.com/kevinrose/2006/07/calacanis.html" title="">up in arms</a> about paying the people that make his site valuable.  Calacanis isn't a genius, he's just <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/25/kevin-rose-cracks-or-how-to-know-when-youve-won-the-debate/" title="">right</a>.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that the era of people making millions off of user generated content is quickly coming to an end.</p>
