<p>(Or, How I Spent My Martin Luther King Day Weekend)</p>

<p>Here are the web app frameworks I've been reading about and playing with for the last few days. As usual, they've got a bunch of cool ideas that we'll be seeing in mainstream frameworks in 4 or 5 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/">Weblocks</a>:  Weblocks is a continuations-based web framework written in Common Lisp. Think Seaside, in Lisp.</p>

<p><a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a>: An MVC framework written in Ruby. Like Rails without all of the garbage and magic. </p>

<p>Check them out.  Pretty cool stuff going on.</p>
