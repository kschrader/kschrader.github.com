<p>Mark Cuban has posted a <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000123070608/" title="Success &amp; Motivation - Redux">bunch of links to blog entries of his about how he succeeded in business</a> and they're all good reads.</p>

<p>The best link by far though is <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000187035671/" title="The Sport of Business">The Sport of Business</a>.  It hits it spot on about the games that have to be played to win at business.  </p>

<p>I'm realizing that I'm reaching the point in my life where the thing that gets me going more than anything else is those games.  It's far more fun to be in the mix of things then to be an onlooker.  Winning at this competition promises to be more rewarding than anything else I've ever done.  Once you make that realization and decide to turn that corner I don't think that there's any going back.</p>
