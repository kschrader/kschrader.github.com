<p>Does anyone out there really watch video blogs?  I mean outside of the closed circle that is the tech community?   This is a serious question.  I saw the <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/rocketbooming/nerdfight.html" title="rocketbooming">brewing fight over video blogging</a> over at zefrank and it made me wonder who really watches video blogs.</p>

<p>I've watched RocketBoom before and it's not good.  I can't imagine showing it to my mom, or brother, or friend, or anyone I like really, unless I wanted to annoy them.  So who are these 350,000 people a day watching it?  I've been trying to break it down, and here's what I've got so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 people: friends of the creators</li>
<li>10,000 people: people that read something about it on a blog, started a video, and then closed the window after 15 seconds</li>
<li>339,980 people: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>That's the best I can do.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, it looks like the <a href="http://www.dembot.com/011160.html" title="">creator of RocketBoom says</a> that he gets 15,000 phone distributions of his content each day.  That's already more than my numbers come out to, so I decided to go try to watch RocketBoom on my phone, as maybe it's better on there.  </p>

<p>Needless to say, it reset my Treo when I tried to start the video.  I can't really blame Rocketboom for that though, as everything seems to reset my Treo.</p>

<p>So finally I decided to go watch Rocketboom one more time, just to see if I remembered wrong.  Maybe it really is more interesting than I remember and maybe 350,000 people a day would really watch it.</p>

<p>I got through about 15 seconds before I closed the window.</p>
