<p>So <a href="http://www.ajaxwrite.com/" title="AjaxWrite">AjaxWrite</a> is out today with a ton of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/03/22/meet-ajax-write/" title="Meet Ajax Write">coverage</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/23/1119/" title="AjaxWrite, the Newest Ajax Office Entrant">surrounding</a> it.  It's another Word clone written in Javascript, which I don't find entirely exciting, especially when compared to some of <a href="http://www.writely.com" title="Writely">the competition</a>.</p>

<p>The demo document when you open AjaxWrite does include the following sentence though:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Also, sign up on AjaxLaunch to get priority notice of a new AJAX program launching every Wednesday!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, a new AJAX program every Wednesday!</p>

<p>Well, that's exciting.  There are 5 mystery question mark boxes at the top of the AjaxWrite page, so let's guess what they're going to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>AjaxSheet</li>
<li>AjaxPoint</li>
<li>AjaxMessenger</li>
<li>AjaxDB</li>
<li>AjaxDraw</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps we should set up a little contest to see who can guess the most correct AjaxWednesday apps.  The winner gets an AjaxPrize.</p>
