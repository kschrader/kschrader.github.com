<p>I came across <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/large-enterprises-and-why-they-dont.html" title="Large Enterprises and why they don't care about Ruby">this post</a> today called "Large Enterprises and why they don't care about Ruby".  In it, the author says that Large Enterprises don't care about Ruby, which I think is a case that we could argue to an extent, but we don't need to, because there's no "why" in there.</p>

<p>Does:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Name one system Fortune 200 enterprise that has a mission-critical system written in a dynamic language.  Of course, you can't.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mean that they don't care about Ruby?  No, it says nothing about a company caring about Ruby.</p>

<p>And let's see:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>JPMorgan uses Cincom Smalltalk's VisualWorks as the technological "engine" of their KAPITAL system, which is the world's most advanced financial risk management and pricing system. (<a href="http://smalltalk.cincom.com/index.ssp" title="Cincom Smalltalk Homepage">1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortune 200?  Check.  Mission-critical?  Check.  Dynamic Language?  Check.</p>

<p>That took all of 30 seconds of Googling.  </p>

<p>The rest of the post is similarly lacking in substance.  I'm no Ruby zealot, but I was hoping to join the discussion about Ruby’s place in the Enterprise.  So answer the damn question, James McGovern, why don’t they care about Ruby?</p>
