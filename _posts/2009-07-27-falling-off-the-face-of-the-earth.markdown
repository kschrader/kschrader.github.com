<p>Quick update on the last 6 months:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Moved back across the country to NYC</li>
	<li>Took a job as Head of Engineering at Intent Media (<a href="http://www.intentmedia.com/im-jobs">We're Hiring!</a> <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-intent-media-raises-8-million-in-first-round-for-advertising-on-e-comme/">We're funded!</a>)</li>
	<li>Been working in Java and Rails</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've got plenty of things to write about, so I'll try to get back on the horse soon.
