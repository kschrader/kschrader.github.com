I'm always meaning to do more blogging, but I always seem to have a million reasons that I never do. One of the things that I've always disliked was dealing with all of the overhead. I don't want to log in and type things in a Javascript window, etc. I just want to blog.

For that reason I've moved my blog to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a highly customizable static site generator that's used to generate most of the pages on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. It lets me write all of my blog posts in a text editor, so that (hypothetically) I can no blog anywhere and everywhere. The philosophy behind it can be found in the original blog post on it, <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Blogging Like a Hacker</a>.

So there's one more excuse for not blogging knocked off of my list. Hopefully I'll do a better job of it.

(Oh, also, porting my blog over is a work in progress. If you see any bugs please let me know in the comments.)
