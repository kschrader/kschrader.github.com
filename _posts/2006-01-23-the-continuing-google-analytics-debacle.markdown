<p>Let me start off this post by saying that I love <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>.  I use it pretty much every day to monitor the traffic to this site and to several others.  In concept, it's a great application.</p>

<p>Now if they could only just get the damn thing to work.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what they were expecting three months ago when they launched, but they must have been off by an order of magnitude or so with their estimates about the number of signups.  That's the only way that I can explain taking 3 months just to get back to the point of letting people sign up again.</p>

<p>Did they do any load testing at all on this thing?  I still find it to be a regular occurrence where the initial summary page just sits there, refusing to show me my data.  Even after multiple refreshes I still end up with nothing.  The solution?  Come back in a few hours.</p>

<p>Now I know that this is a free service and I should be happy with what I got, but just because something is free doesn't mean that you shouldn't finish it and get it tested before you send it out the door.  If you own the world's most powerful computer, I feel like you really shouldn't be having simple application load problems.</p>

<p>Oh well, I guess I'll just keep using it when it works and continue waiting patiently for a <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/" title="Measure Map">Measure Map</a> invitation...</p>
