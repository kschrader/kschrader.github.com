<p>I just spent a while removing all of the trackback spam that some jack ass left on my blog.  Although Typo seems to have a good number of ways to prevent it, it still seems to crop up fairly often.  Anybody have a good strategy for fighting it?</p>

<p>Hopefully we'll get some more plugins soon on this front.</p>
