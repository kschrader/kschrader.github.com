I've moved my blog again.  The new URL is<a href="http://kurt.karmalab.org"> http://kurt.karmalab.org/ </a>.  I've moved it away from the <a href="http://codehaus.org">codehaus</a> because I'm not really involved there anymore, and I've been broadening my horizons from the technology focus that I ended up talking about there.  This should be a more general blog going forward, and hopefully one that's updated more than quarterly.  My old blog archives can be found <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/kschrader/">here</a>, and my really old blog archives can be found <a href="http://karmalab.org/~kschrader/blog/">here</a>.
