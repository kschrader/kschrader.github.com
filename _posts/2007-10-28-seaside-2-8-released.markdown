<p><a href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside</a>, my other favorite framework, released version 2.8 today.  This release has been optimized and optimized some more, as it doubles the average page rendering speed, and now uses up to 4 times less memory.  Plus it supports <a href="http://seaside.gemstone.com/">Gemstone</a>, which is the feature that I'm most excited about playing with.</p>

<p>The official release page is <a href="http://www.seaside.st/community/development/seaside28">here</a>, and if you still haven't tried Squeak, a great new tutorial can be found <a href="http://www.swa.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/seaside/tutorial">here</a>.</p>

<p>Congrats to the entire Squeak team on this one. </p>

<p>(Seriously though, who does a release on a Sunday?  You guys are nuts.)</p>
