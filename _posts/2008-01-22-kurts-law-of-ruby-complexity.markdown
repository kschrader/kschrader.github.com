<p>My new law of Ruby complexity:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For a Ruby application increasing in size at rate of X, with an amount of cleverness to cover up the complexity increasing at rate Y, the quantity Y is always greater than X, and Y eventually approaches positive infinity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working on Ruby projects has given me enough examples of "Where did that method come from?" to last a lifetime.</p>
