<p>I have 43 blogs in my blogroll, read various news sites daily, write in two journals, write in this blog, and somehow manage to go to work everyday.  Despite all of this, I feel like my overall ability to comprehend and process information continues to go down lately.  It's either that or my brain just can't keep up with all of the info coming out of the firehose.  Luckily, I've found a solution, at least for this week.  I'm going on <a href="http://www.sunvalley.com/" title="Sun Valley Resort Online">vacation</a>.  See you next week, when hopefully my brain will be functioning once again.</p>
