<p><a href="http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2006/2006_0124_pixar.html" title="Disney buys Pixar">The rumors were true.</a>  I always figured that thing things were over after <a href="http://www.defamer.com/hollywood/business/steve-jobs-plays-the-dozens-with-michael-eisner-032886.php" title="">Jobs said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our films don’t stack up to ‘Atlantis,’ ‘Emperor’s New Groove’ or ‘Treasure Planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but never say never, apparently.  Here's to hoping that Disney lets John Lasseter continue making great movies, and doesn't screw up the Pixar magic too much.</p>
