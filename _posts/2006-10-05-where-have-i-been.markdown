<p>So it's been awhile since I've posted and a lot changes have been down, so here's a quick update.</p>

<ul>
<li>We've decided to back-burner the <a href="http://www.squishr.com" title="Squishr">Squishr</a> project at <a href="http://www.tentonlabs.com" title="Ten Ton Labs">Ten Ton Labs</a> for now.  It was an awesome project and I'm really proud of what came out of it, but we've decided to take the technology in a different direction for the time being.  Stay tuned...</li>
<li>To pay my bills I've taken a new position that I'm really excited about at <a href="http://www.collaborativedrug.com" title="Collaborative Drug Discovery">Collaborative Drug Discovery</a>, which is yet another start-up.  We're still fairly stealthy about things, so I'm not going to say too much about what I'm doing there yet, but rest assured that I'll have a lot more to say in the future.</li>
<li>I've laid out the initial ideas for a new framework that I'm working on for writing web-apps.  It takes [steals] a lot of ideas from my work with Rails and Seaside and tries to tie them together.  It's still very early stage at this point.  The initial implementation is in Ruby, but whether or not it remains that way is up in the air.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that's the quick rundown of things.  I'm going to try to get back to posting more regularly now that things aren't quite as hectic with my life.</p>
