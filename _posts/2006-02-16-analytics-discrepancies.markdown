<p>I've been using Measure Map for a few weeks and Google Analytics for a few months and I'm somewhat confused by the visitor numbers I'm seeing.  Looking at the first half of January, Measure Map is reporting that I've gotten about 20% less visitors than Google Analytics.  Now one of those numbers has to be wrong, but which one?</p>

<p>Well, I also have a BlogBeat account, and the data there is very similar (within 1%) to the Measure Map results.  Thus, it looks like Google Analytics has some sort of problem where it is skewing the number of visitors up by about 20% on my blog.  </p>

<p>Now I'm not asking for super precision from these services, but is anyone else experiencing this?  I would like some confirmation that others are seeing something similar before I try to figure out what's happening.  (and before <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/14/google-buys-measuremap/" title="Google Buys MeasureMap">Google slaps the Measure Map front end on the Analytics back end</a> and all of my stats get inflated by 20%)</p>
