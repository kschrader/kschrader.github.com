<p>I see that several more blog <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/31/askcombloglines-launch-blog-search/" title="Finally! Bloglines Blog Search">search</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/02/the-other-blog-search-engine-that-launched-yesterday/" title="The Other Blog Search Engine That Launched Yesterday">engines</a> have launched over the last few days, so I just did a quick survey of people at the coffee shop and over IM asking, "have you ever used a blog search engine to search for something?"</p>

<p>The answer I got from every single person?  "No."</p>

<p>I'm not exactly in a little coffee house in the middle of nowhere either.  <a href="http://www.ritualroasters.com/" title="Ritual Coffee Roasters">This place</a> should be filled with people right at the core of who should be using blog search engines.</p>

<p>I think that the real problem is that no one ever says "I really want to search for something, but I only want results about it from blogs."  It's just not a compelling vertical.</p>
