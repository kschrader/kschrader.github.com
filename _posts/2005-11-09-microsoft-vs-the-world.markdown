<p>The blogosphere is abuzz over the leaked Microsoft memos from Bill Gates and Ray Ozzie that are found <a href="http://www.hypercamp.org/2005/11/09#a43" title="Exclusive: Full text of Gates email, Ozzie memo">here</a>.  I've read the memos, and I can't help but wonder if Microsoft can really win a battle where the enemy is coming at it from all sides.  History shows that if Microsoft has a well defined enemy, they can turn into a juggernaut and run them over.  It'll be interesting to see how they deal with a battle that includes numerous small competitors.  As many countries have learned in the past, guerrilla warfare is much harder to fight and requires a whole different set of tactics than standard warfare.</p>
