<p>Is anyone else with me on the fact that <a href="http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr/" title="retrievr">retrievr</a> (via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/03/the-retrievr-flickr-tool/" title="The Retrievr Flickr Tool">TechCrunch</a>) would be much cooler if you could click on one of the images that you've found and do a new search off of that?  I'm not sure if the technology would support that at this point, but it sure would be cool if it could.</p>
