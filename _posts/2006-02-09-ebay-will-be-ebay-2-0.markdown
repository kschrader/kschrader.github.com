<p>I'm confused about the all of the <a href="http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/02/edgeio_edges_ou.html" title="Edgeio Edges Toward Launch--and a Clash with E-Commerce Giants?">hype</a> <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/edgeio-opens-new-era-in-blogging/" title="Edgeio opens new era in blogging">around</a> <a href="http://www.edgeio.com/" title="EdgeIO">EdgeIO</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2565" title="Edgeio stakes out the listing tag">today</a>.  Sure it's an awesome idea, but if it catches on then what's stopping eBay or Craigslist from:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buying or building a blog search engine.</li>
<li>Crawling for the "listing" tag and adding the entries to their listings.</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I was an eBay exec I would already have a team of people building this into the platform, just in case it catches on.</p>

<p>I like the idea of EdgeIO, and I haven't had a demo, so I'm not sure what they offer that eBay doesn't, but I can't help but feel like they're going to be another classic example of a company with a great idea that gets killed by the second-movers in the market.</p>
