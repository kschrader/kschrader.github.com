<p>Or perhaps "Complain, and Ye Shall Receive."  After my post complaining about <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> earlier this week, I got a <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/" title="Measure Map">Measure Map</a> invitation in my Inbox.  Thank you to Jeffrey Veen for that one.  (And thanks to Measure Map for having an install tutorial for <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/" title="typo">Typo</a>.)</p>

<p>I've also decided to install <a href="http://blogbeat.net/" title="Blogbeat">Blogbeat</a>, as suggested by Jeff from Blogbeat in the comments.  I'm going to give those two services a week or so to gather some statistics, and then I'll write up a more detailed comparison of all three.</p>

<p>It ought to be interesting to see what these services are doing to differentiate from one another.  If anyone knows of any other blog analytics services that I should include in this shootout, let me know.</p>
