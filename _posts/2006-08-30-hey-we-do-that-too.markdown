title: Hey, we do that at Squishr too!  (So do a ton of other sites.)

<p>It's <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/30/viewscore-aggregates-gadget-reviews/" title="">yet another review aggregation site</a>.  This time for gadgets.  </p>

<p>Marshall says:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The cool technology here though is that the site normalizes numeric ratings across sites that use different scales (a number out of ten or up to five stars are converted to a score out of 100)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same thing we've been doing at <a href="http://www.squishr.com" title="Squishr">Squishr</a> with music for a while now.</p>

<p>This is actually a bit of deja vu for me, as we originally had our technology working on gadgets, but we moved to music because we found that gadget reviews just didn't end up that useful in the grand scheme of things.  People tended to say the same thing over and over again in their gadget reviews (good/bad interface, good/bad battery life, etc), and let's face it, if you're going to buy an mp3 player it's going to be an iPod.  </p>

<p>I do agree with Marshall when he says that there's room for a lot of entries into this space.  Things should be interesting.</p>
