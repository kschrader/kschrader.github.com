Google Mail surprised me this morning with an ad at the top of my email instead of a normal web clip:

<img title="Web Clip Ad" src="http://kurt.karmalab.org/files/gmailAd.jpg" alt="Web Clip Ad" />

I guess that Google is trying to eke a little more revenue out of Gmail.  I wonder what the actual click through rate is though.  I don't think that I have ever clicked on a Gmail ad.  It doesn't seem like it would be part of the normal flow of reading email for most people.
