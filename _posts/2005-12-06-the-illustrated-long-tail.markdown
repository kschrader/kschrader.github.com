<p>As I push more and more of my personal data out on to the internet, I see more and more examples of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" title="The Long Tail">long tail</a> in my own activities.  Today's illustrated example is my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/kschrader/charts/&amp;charttype=overall&amp;subtype=artist" title="kschrader's Charts">Last.fm top artists chart</a>.  It looks like Johnny Cash could use a little more iTunes loving on my part.  (By the way, if you haven't already, see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273/" title="Walk the Line">Walk the Line</a>.  One of the best flicks I've seen this year.)</p>
