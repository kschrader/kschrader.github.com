<p>Looks like <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?p=78" title="did you hear?">Meebo got funded by Sequoia</a>.  I'm not seeing a business model here, but then again, who knows.  I can tell you though, that very soon Meebo is going to find themselves on the block lists of all of the major firewalls.  When that happens they're going to lose a big chunk of their users who are currently coming in from work/school to chat.  (Really, why would I use Meebo if it wasn't to get around a firewall?  Dedicated clients are a far more feature rich choice.)  Ought to be interesting to see how they handle that.
