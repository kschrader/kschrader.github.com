<p>I'm not sure what to make of my experience with United today.  I've given them <a href="http://kurt.karmalab.org/articles/2006/02/04/united-airlines-ps-service-is-outstanding">a good review</a> on this blog before, but today made me remember why I hate dealing with them.</p>

<p>The story starts last night when I sleepily booked two tickets to Chicago from San Francisco for later this month.  This morning when I woke up I realized that I used my girlfriend's nickname on the ticket instead of her proper legal name.    No problem, I thought, I'll just call up and have them change the first name on the ticket.</p>

<p>That's when the fun began.  After I spent fifteen minutes navigating the robot phone system to get to a (hard to understand, off-shored) person, I was told that I couldn't change the name on a ticket without a $100 change fee.  </p>

<p>A $100 change fee.  </p>

<p>To change a first name.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that this is what the change fee was for.  I can understand charging me if I want to change to a different flight, but why would they try to charge me $100 to change the first name of the person on the flight.  The only explanation I could come up with is that they were intentionally trying to irritate me.</p>

<p>So i did the only sensible thing.  I hung up and called back under the assumption that the first person was crazy.  (But not before checking on <a href="http://gethuman.com/">gethuman.com</a> before calling back to figure out how to avoid the robot phone system.)</p>

<p>This rep informed of the same thing that the last rep did, but luckily, I had another out.  The customer service rep on the phone informed me that since I had purchased the ticket within the last 24 hours, the ticket could be canceled with a full refund and rebooked.  That made sense, so I told her to go ahead and do that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the magical airline ticket pricing system that we all know and love, the price of the exact same flight had increased by $96 since 12 hours before.  And there was a $15 fee for booking over the phone.</p>

<p>Wonderful.</p>

<p>So I had two choices, change the name and pay a $100 change fee, or cancel the ticket and pay the $96 + $15 difference.  </p>

<p>Obviously, neither of these options appealed to me to change a first name.</p>

<p>So the first tact I took was to try to get them to waive the change fee.  This has worked for me before on a number of airlines (Continental, Frontier, etc) and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal, since this wasn't really a big change to the ticket.</p>

<p>After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I was informed that that couldn't be done.</p>

<p>I would love to personally thank the supervisor who made that decision.</p>

<p>Eventually what I ended up doing was to have the original ticket refunded and book in a different time that was only $15 more expensive then the original flight that I booked.</p>

<p>So far this cost me $15 and an hour of my time.</p>

<p>To change a first name.</p>

<p>And I ended up with a less convenient flight.</p>

<p>Absurd.</p>

<p>The final slap in the face came just now, when I checked back on United's site.  It seems that the pricing fairies have set the price of the flight that I wanted back down to the price of the flight that I booked today.</p>

<p>Thanks, United.  I'm done flying your friendly skies.</p>
