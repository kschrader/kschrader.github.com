<blockquote>
    <p>Watching Google and RSS is like watching a high school student experiment with a chemistry set. Meanwhile Yahoo and Microsoft are busy inserting RSS into their DNA.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, I get almost all of the information I now consume via RSS.  Currently, I'm even looking for a new apartment by using the Craigslist RSS feed, instead of heading off to their website for info like I used to do.  I think that I'm using Google less now than ever, and I only see my usage of them continuing to slide.  The train has already left the station here, Google better hurry up and get on board.</p>
