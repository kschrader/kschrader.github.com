<p>Today's <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/131902/2008/02/1052applelistens.html">10.5.2 update</a> to Mac OS X seems to have solved my issue of losing wireless connectivity every half-hour and having to reboot to get it back.
I was about ready to throw my laptop out of the window with this one.  How was I supposed to get work done when the internet was constantly going away?</p>

<p>I wasn't sure how much more I could have taken before I just installed Linux on this box to get back to work.</p>

<p>So thank you Apple for saving my laptop. And thank you for not making me go through the pain of dealing with a dual-boot Linux box once again.</p>
