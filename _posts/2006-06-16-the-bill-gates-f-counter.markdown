<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html" title="My First BillG Review">Today's post</a> on Joel on Software is great, but I love this line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In my BillG review meeting, the whole reporting hierarchy was there, along with their cousins, sisters, and aunts, and a person who came along from my team whose whole job during the meeting was to keep an accurate count of how many times Bill said the F word. The lower the f<em>*</em>-count, the better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who was once accused of "using the F word like a comma" it's good to know that it won't hurt my career prospects.</p>
