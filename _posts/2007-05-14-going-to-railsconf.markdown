<p>I'll be heading to RailsConf later this week.  <a href="http://myconfplan.com/users/kschrader/conferences/RailsConf2007">Here</a>, via MyConfPlan, are the sessions that I'll supposedly be attending, although it's more likely that you'll find me chatting in the hall or over near the <a href="http://blog.aslakhellesoy.com/">Aslak</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there.</p>
