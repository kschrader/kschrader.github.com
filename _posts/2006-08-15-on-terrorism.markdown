<p>This is a well thought out <a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2006/08/wait-arent-you-scared.html" title="">response</a> to the recent terrorist activity.  I especially like this throwback moment:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>FDR: Oh, I'm sorry, was wiping out our entire Pacific fleet supposed to intimidate us? We have nothing to fear but fear itself, and right now we're coming to kick your ass with brand new destroyers riveted by waitresses. How's that going to feel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not doing any of any good to be scared.</p>
