<p>Since I've been spending all of my time in SF lately, instead of NYC, I decided to spend this week out meeting the locals.  </p>

<p>On Wednesday I went to the <a href="http://106miles.org/" title="106 Miles">106 Miles</a> event (which, strangely enough, isn't mentioned on their homepage) and listened to <a href="http://www.evhead.com/" title="evhead">Evan</a> talk about his <a href="http://evhead.com/2005/11/ten-rules-for-web-startups.asp" title="Ten Rules for Web Startups">Ten Rules for Web Startups</a>.  Cool crowd, plenty of early stage stuff going on there, good stories about Blogger almost dying several times over, good time had by all.  The <a href="http://blog.skobee.com/" title="skobee snacks">word on the street</a> is that this is going to become a monthly meeting, which would be awesome.</p>

<p>Last night I went to the <a href="http://wsfinder.jot.com/WikiHome/SF+Web+Innovators" title="SF Web Innovators">SF Web Innovators</a> meeting and met a bunch more cool people.  No formal talk, but lots of beer and sushi. Met a <a href="http://www.greylock.com/team/bio.cfm?Id=28" title="Greylock -Team">friend</a> of an old friend that led to a great story that may or may not be the topic of another blog entry.  Also tried to pry out some info about what <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/" title="Radar Networks">Radar Networks</a> is working on, but despite now knowing even <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/" title="Minding The Planet">more</a> <a href="http://www.rubylabs.com/" title="Welcome to Ruby Labs">people</a> that work there now than I <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/bob/" title="bob mcwhirter -Main">did</a> <a href="http://fotap.org/~osi/" title="one day">before</a>, I still don't know.  Again though, good times all around.  (I was surprised that there was no people overlap between the two meetings though.  There needs to be a better way to get the word out about these things.)</p>
