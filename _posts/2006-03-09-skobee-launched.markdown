<p>So <a href="http://www.skobee.com" title="Skobee">Skobee</a> has finally launched and it looks like we've got a little problem here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kschrader/110231764/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/110231764_6cbbbcb0d8.jpg" width="500" height="230" alt="skobee" /></a></p>

<p>I'll just chalk that up to being in beta.  </p>

<p>Seriously though, congrats to all of the Skobee guys.  It looks like it's going to be a super useful service.</p>
