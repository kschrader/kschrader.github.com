<p>My friend Pat just pointed out <a href="http://www.whatwouldjesusdownload.com/christianubuntu/2006/07/about-ubuntu-christian-edition.html">Ubuntu Christian Edition </a> and I just had to wonder if is it intelligently designed.  It looks to me like Linux evolved over many versions into what it is today.  </p>

<p>I can only imagine that some people out there are feeling conflicted over that.</p>
