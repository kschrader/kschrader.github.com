<p>Following the lead of any number of failing technology companies, Friendster has <a href="http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=17498&amp;hed=Friendster+Wins+Patent" title="Friendster Wins Patent">announced</a> that they have a patent on a "system, method, and apparatus for connecting users in an online computer system based on their relationships within social networks.”  It should be interesting to see what sort of affect this has on the big players in the space.</p>

<p>At the very least, I've got to assume that they’re a much more attractive acquisition target today then they were a few days ago.</p>
