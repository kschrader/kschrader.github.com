<p>Someone is finally writing a nice language level comparison of Ruby and Smalltalk, without any of the bias that we normally see in one of these things.  I'm still convinced that you can't really see the power of programming in Smalltalk until you really <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">try it</a> (kind of like how Java programmers can't really see the power of Ruby until they try it) but hopefully this will encourage a few more people to give it a go.</p>

<p>Check out the article <a href="http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-The-Smalltalk-Way-1">here</a>.</p>
