<p>Today is my last day at Thoughtworks.  </p>

<p>After two years and an excessive number of plane flights, the time has come to head back into the start-up game and <a href="http://www.tentonlabs.com" title="Ten Ton Labs">try something new</a>.  </p>

<p>I'll miss all of the great people I've been lucky enough to work with during my two years consulting (except for <a href="http://www.feldt.com" title="Feldt.com">Feldt</a>, of course).  If any of you are in SF and want to take me out to dinner on your expense accounts, be sure to drop me a line.</p>
