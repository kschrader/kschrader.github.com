<p>You can tell it's getting close to the end of year, as the tech ideas that normally seem to come fast and furious seem to have tapered off a bit, and my day is a little more boring because of it.  This week so far we've got <a href="http://cingular.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=pageB&amp;item=3" title="Cingular 3G">"High Speed" Cingular cell phone access</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/dec/06nbc.html" title="NBC Universal &amp; Apple Offer New Primetime, Cable, Late-Night &amp; Classic TV Shows on the iTunes Music Store">NBC shows on iTunes</a>, and <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/12/oh_hell_yeah.html" title="Rhapsody for the Mac">Rhapsody for the Mac</a>.  Not exactly groundbreaking stuff.  </p>

<p>Ah well, I suppose we've got January to look forward to, although hopefully someone will surprise me before then.</p>
