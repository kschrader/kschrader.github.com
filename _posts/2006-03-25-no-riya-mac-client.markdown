<p>How I just wasted 5 minutes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Saw that Riya Beta is <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/03/door-is-open.html" title="The Door is Open">now open to everyone</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Went to the Riya site and signed up.</p></li>
<li><p>Was told that I needed Windows XP.</p></li>
<li><p>Realized that it wasn't open to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Closed browser window.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Seriously, what new web company doesn't launch with Macintosh compatibility in mind.  How hard is it to write an uploader?  What would it take?  Two, maybe three days of a developer's time?  </p>

<p>Or better yet, just implement a clone of the Flickr API and be done with it.  </p>

<p>Unless the uploader is doing a bunch of preprocessing of the photos on the desktop beforehand, I can't really see any good reason for not offering a Mac client.</p>
