<p>I've pulled the my tag cloud off of the sidebar of the blog, as I'm not finding it to be a very good way <a href="http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2005/12/the_future_of_t.html" title="The Future of Tags: Cloudy">to visualize data</a> about what I'm writing about.  As you can see:</p>

<p>the web2.0 tag is so big in this cloud that everything else gets swallowed up. I still think that tags are a good way to classify information, but the whole cloud growth idea seems to be flawed once one topic gets too much traction.  Perhaps we could have a cloud where all of the words are the same size, but they have different intensities.  Or maybe I just need to write less about web2.0.  :)</p>
