<p>I just downloaded and installed the <a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/">Cruisecontrol.rb </a> 1.0 release that was just put out by some of my old co-workers at Thoughtworks earlier today.  It literally took about 2 minutes to get builds up and running with our project.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, it seems to be exactly what you would want out of a CI tool, it's easy to install and it gets out of your way until a build fails.  Good stuff.</p>
