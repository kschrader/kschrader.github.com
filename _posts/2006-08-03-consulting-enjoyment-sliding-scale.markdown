<p>Occasionally, we here at the <a href="http://www.tentonlabs.com" title="Ten Ton Labs">Ten Ton Labs</a> take on a consulting gig or two.  After some discussion, I've come up with the following easy-to-follow chart for consulting gigs.  It lists all of the languages that we write applications in, and gives some idea of what we would charge to produce an app in each language.</p>

<p>This chart is rooted in our belief that making someone write C++ code is somewhat similar to straight torture.  </p>

<p>The irony, of course, is that it takes quite a bit longer to write something in C++, on top of the higher rates.  </p>

<p>As always, contact me at <a href="mailto:kurt@tentonlabs.com" title="">kurt@tentonlabs.com</a> if you want to discuss a potential engagement.</p>
