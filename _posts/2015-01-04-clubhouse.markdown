Over the last 15 years I've been privileged to work with some of the greatest engineers in our industry to build software and teams. 

These teams have always been greater than the sum of their parts, and I owe everyone that I've ever worked with a debt of gratitude for that.

However, in all of that time, and in most of the teams that I've been exposed to, we haven't done a very good job of predicting when things are going to be done. We don't do a good job of explaining to people how things are changing and we never seem so assess and address risks fast enough, before they become bigger problems.

Enter [Clubhouse](https://www.clubhousehq.com).

[Andrew Childs](https://twitter.com/andrewchilds) and I started Clubhouse to help companies build better software teams.

We want to use the data that teams are already generating to help the engineering side of a company communicate progress, share their risks, and get better at predicting what's going to happen in the future, all while lowering the level of overhead that engineers have to deal with on a day-to-day basis.

I'll have a lot more to say about what we're building over the next few months, but I'm personally very excited about this, as it feels like the culmination of everything that I've been thinking about for the last 15 years.

As one person that I've known for a long time said:

> You've just taken what you've been talking about for the last 10 years and built it.

That's exactly how it feels.

If you're interested in seeing what we're building or joining the alpha, don't hesitate to [drop me a line](mailto:kurt@clubhousehq.com).
